<p>A striking presence at the corner of Baltimore Avenue and Campus Drive, the Brendan Iribe Center
will be a hub for technology at the heart of a new innovation district, among high-tech companies, government agencies and institutional colleagues.
</p>

<p>
Bringing together the university's top-ranked Department of Computer Science and its
renowned Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), the building's six floors of
specialized labs will support groundbreaking research in virtual and augmented reality,
artificial intelligence, robotics, computer vision, algorithms, programming languages and
systems.
</p>

<p>
Students and faculty alike will experiment and create in open work areas and
makerspaces filled with natural light. Flexible classrooms will promote teamwork and active
learning. And welcoming common areas - including an expansive green space along
Baltimore Avenue - will extend the collaborative environment to the broader community.
